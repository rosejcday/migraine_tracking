## Local Development

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

1. Go to [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/). Then add Google Drive API to our project which will allow us to access spreadsheet inside of Google Sheets for our account. Once thatâ€™s added, we need to create some credentials to access the API so click on ***Add Credentials*** on the next screen you see after enabling the API. This JSON file should be added to the root directory of the repository.

1. Setup a [Twilio account and number](https://www.twilio.com/console).

1. Setup `twilio.env` in the twilio_application directory to contain a secret key using the `twilio.env_example` file. This secret is required for a session in Flask to run. To use this file, remove the `_example` from the filename and add in a secret key and Twilio phone number.

1. Install the requirements.

  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

1. Start the development server.

  ```bash
  cd automated_survey/
  python3 -m app run # Run the Flask application
  ```

1. Expose your application to the wider internet using ngrok. To forward incoming messages, your development server will need to be publicly accessible.

  ```bash
  ngrok http 5000
  ```

  Once you have started ngrok, update your TwiML app's SMS messaging URL setting to use your ngrok hostname.

  It will look something like this:

  ```bash
  http://demo.ngrok.io/sms
  ```

  Your app's SMS messaging URL can be set in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) under Active Numbers. Once there, click on your number and scroll to the bottom where it says Messaging. Once there, you will select wehook and insert your ngrok URL.

### Demo

Below, you will see a demo of the application being run:

## Running the tests

You can run the tests locally using pytest.

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/
```

You can then view the results by building an HTML report with `pytest --cov=automated_survey tests/ --cov-report html`.
