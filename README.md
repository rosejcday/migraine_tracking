# Automated Survey with for Tracking Migraines

***

**Note**

Currently a work in progress - development on using spreadsheets is being worked on at the moment and learning to interact with Twilio API.

***

## Quickstart

### Technologies

Python 3

### Local development

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

1. Go to Google API Manager https://console.developers.google.com/. Then add Google Drive API to our project which will allow us to access spreadsheet inside of Google Sheets for our account. Once thatâ€™s added, we need to create some credentials to access the API so click on ***Add Credentials*** on the next screen you see after enabling the API. This JSON file should be added to the root directory of the repository.

1. Setup `twilio.env` in the twilio_application directory to contain a secret key using the `twilio.env_example` file. This secret is required for a session in Flask to run. To use this file, remove the `_example` from the filename and add in a secret key and Twilio phone number.

1. Install the requirements.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Start the development server.

```bash
cd automated_survey/
python3 -m app run # Run the Flask application
```

1. Expose your application to the wider internet using ngrok. To forward incoming messages, your development server will need to be publicly accessible.

```bash
$ ngrok http 5000
```

Once you have started ngrok, update your TwiML app's SMS messaging URL setting to use your ngrok hostname.
It will look something like this:

```bash
http://demo.ngrok.io/sms
```

## Running the tests

You can run the tests locally using pytest.

1. Run the tests.

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/
```

You can then view the results by building an HTML report with `pytest --cov=automated_survey tests/ --cov-report html`.

1. Run tests.

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/
```
