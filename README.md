### Local development

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

1. Go to Google API Manager https://console.developers.google.com/. Then add Google Drive API to our project which will allow us to access spreadsheet inside of Google Sheets for our account. Once thatâ€™s added, we need to create some credentials to access the API so click on ***Add Credentials*** on the next screen you see after enabling the API. This JSON file should be added to the root directory of the repository.

1. Install the requirements.

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ```bash
    python3 -m pytest tests/
