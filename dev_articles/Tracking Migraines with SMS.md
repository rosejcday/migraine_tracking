Happy Friday! I am excited to try something new and begin working with Twilio's APIs.

## Category - Engaging Engagements

I am focusing on two categories during this hackathon: Engaging Engagements and Interesting Integrations. 

**Engaging Engagements** looks at developing applications that a company could implement to better engage with their customers or to manage their business and **Interesting Integrations** focuss on the integration of Twilio with at least one other API.

## Overview

During this hackathon, I am looking for a simple method to collect data using SMS and Google Sheets. Every month I spend time logging migraines for the doctors office but don't remember the questions she commonly asks, or the details she found important from my last appointment. This application is being created as a way to log migraines in Google Sheets by quickly filling out the details of a survey sent through SMS. The user can then print off the sheet that has been populated and bring it with them to their next doctor's appointment.

### Commonly Asked Questions for Migraines

- In a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your migraine?
- Where is your migraine located today?
- How long did your migraine last (in hours)?
- What medication did you take to treat the migraine?
- Has anything changed? Is anything out of the ordinary?

### Development Stack

I am working with the Twilio API to develop a Python Flask app that generates a survey for migraines and saves the data in a Google Sheet.

I look forward to posting each week my progress and learnings as I tackle this problem. Stay tuned for next weeks post as I begin to utilize Googles API to read and write data to a sheet!
